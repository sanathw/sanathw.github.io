<br>
===========================<br>
Here are my thought:<br>
<br>
1) Bells inequality is NOT always false for every angle....BUT you only need ONE angle where it's false to make Classical wrong and Quantum right. So you can PICK and CHOOSE the angles for the polarizers that best give the difference. See Alain Aspect diagram below<br>
<br>
2) The photon DOESN'T Decide at the polarizer.....It decides at the DETECTOR!<br>
It's when the photon is absorbed and stops being a photon.<br>
The polarization film DOESN'T absorb the photon...but as in Feynman's QED, the atoms in the polarizer on add to the probability.<br>
So an experiment could be to do this:<br>
From the crystal to the polarizers A and B could be the SAME length.....BUT the distance from the polarizer to the detector could be changed.<br>
===========================<br>
<br>
<br>
See:<br>

<br>

This shows that there IS INSTANT communication (either at the start or end) of Quantum Entangled particles.
<br>
AND it shows that certain properties (like polarization) DOESN'T become REAL until it interacts with a polarizer!

<br>
<br>
If entangled, and A is vertical and B is horizontal,
<br>
then if A fires, B will definately not fire.
<br>
and if A does not fire, then B will definately fire.
<br>
<br>
(no matter what angle caused A to fire or not fire...
even if it was 45 deg, B will always fire the opposite of A)
<br>
<br>
So if A fires, then B will not fire.
<br>
A and !B will always match
<br>
And since A fires only half the time, A & !B = 0.5
<br>
Note:
<br>
if (A.fire != B.fire) clicks++; // produces 0.6666 classical and 1  for  Quantum
<br>
if (A.fire && !B.fire) clicks++; // produces 0.3333 classical and 0.5 for Quantum
<br>
<br>
<br>  
But if B is not entangled....then the same is true ONLY if the angle of the photons is 
exactly vertical OR horzontal.
<br>
<b>HOWEVER at 45 deg, A and B have a probability of either BOTH firing or BOTH not firing (as well as firing opposite as above)
<br>
BECAUSE 45 deg MAPS onto vertial some amount AS WELL as mapping to horizontal some amount!
<br>
SO the probability of A and B being different is LESS.
<br>
yes, it is true that they will dEFINATELY be different if the angle was either vertical or horizontal.
<br>
but for any other angle, they will map with some probabilty to BOTH the vertical and horizontal!
<b>
<br>
<br>
Basically, if entangled then A and B will ALWAYS fire opposite!
<br>
BUT if not entangled, then A and B can fire the same sometimes!
