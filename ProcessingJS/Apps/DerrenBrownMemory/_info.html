======================================

With the numbers only 0 - 9 is important
The words must have the 'sound' below (i.e. the key is a consonant) and only other vowel sounds (a, e i, o, u, h).
(otherwise, the key for the number will get confused with another number when you think of a revers mapping from word to numbre)

0      zoo        's' or 'ce' or 'z' 
1      ale         l    (looks like a 1)
2      hen         n    (two lines in the n and hens have two legs)
3      ham          m   (three lines)
4      whore        r
5      hive         'v' or 'f'
6      bee          'b' or 'p'   (looks like a 6 or upside down 6)
7      tea          t     (looks like a 7)
8      shoe         'sh' or 'dge' or 'ch' 
9      goo          g     (looks like a 9)

then all the other numbers are combination of the above (again with vowels between the two consonants)
so:

10     lice       l s
11     lily       l l
12     line       l n
13     lime       l m

39     mag        m g
40     rose       r s
41     rail       r l
42     rain       r n
43     ram        r m
44     roar       r r
45     rave       r v
46     rub        r b
47     root       r t
48     retch      r ch
49     rag        r g
50     fuse       f s
51     fall       f l
52     fan        f n

======================================

With the cards, the word starts with the letter of the suit and ends with the letter of the number.
And again in between are vowel sounds)

Picture stories of the mappings

<br>
NUMBERS
<br>
<br>
(0  -  9)<br>
<blockquote>
0 is Zoo<br>
An ale is sitting on a hen that is pecking on a ham which is covering a whore's private parts withe her legs apart.<br>
The whore's hair is a bee hive, which has a bee flying out of it and it make a path to a tea cup.<br>
The tea cup is sitting on a shoe which as some goo like chewing gum on it's sole.<br>
</blockquote>
<br>
(10 -19)<br>
<blockquote>
A lice is sitting on a wine glass shaped like a Lilly.<br>
Coming out of the win glass is a line and to the end of that is attached a lime.<br>
The whole image of wine glass, lice and lime are circled and is the poster on the side of a lorry.<br>
The lorry driver is laughing because the front of the lorry is big lips for the radiator and lights for eyes.<br>
The lights are on, but that does not matter, since the lorry is on a ledge and about to fall off.<br>
On the other side of the ledge is a woman showing her leg, which is why the driver is driving there.<br>
</blockquote>
<br>
(20 - 29)<br>
<blockquote>
A nose has a nail though it. The nose is on a nanny who is pushing a pram with a gnome in it.<br>
The gnome is actually Nero's baby. Nero is standing there with his arm raised and holding a knife.<br>
The knife is about to cut off a nob.<br>
The knight who is riding a horse and holding a jousting pole is scared of it.<br>
He has notches on the pole and the pole is aiming at a nagging housewife with a rolling pin.<br>
</blockquote>
<br>
(30 - 39)<br>
<blockquote>
A mouse is eating a mail envelope.<br>
So the envelope has a hole in it and dropping cash coins.<br>
The coins fall into a purse that a mummy is holding.<br>
The mummy is happy because she is having a merry party with her girl friends.<br>
The girls have no bottoms on and are showing there muff - which is shaped like a map of Australia.<br>
The girl at the front door is standing on a mat. The mat has a mission impossible line of  gun powder going to a match which is alight and siting on a magazine.<br> 
</blockquote>
<br>
(40 - 49)<br>
<blockquote>
A rose is lying on the rail on a railway track.<br>
It is gloomy and raining.<br>
In the distance on the hilltop is a ram. The ram is roaring. But that does not matter because on another hill there is a big speaker box blasting out music from a rave. On the speaker box is a magic lamp. If you rub the lamp then two genie's come out in a cloud and have a root. But the one on the top is disgusted, so she has a retch. The vomit that is now on the floor needs to be cleaned up with a rag.<br>
</blockquote>
<br>
(50 - 52)<br>
<blockquote>
A fuse is falling and falls into a fan that then switches on.<br>
</blockquote>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CARDS<br>
<br>
Spades<br>
<blockquote>
The grim reaper has his hand over his eyes because the sun is too bright.<br>
The sun also gives power to a solar powered calculator which can do sums.<br>
Acountants do sums. The accountant has a sore foot because he hit it on a safe. This makes him sob. In addition, the fireplace where they are spills its soot and goes on everyone.<br>
The fire in the fireplace was started by a beauty pagent winner with a sash. She is not classy though because she is smoking a ciggy. She is dominant and the nerdy host of the show has a bow tie and is a sissy.<br>
</blockquote>
<br>
Hearts<br>
<blockquote>
There is a big heart helium balloon above two lovers.<br>
The lovers are home in the castle tower.<br>
The girl is rapansle and her hair comes out of the tower to the ground.<br>
The man climbed the hair to get in.<br>
The hair on the ground is held down by the hoof of a cow.<br>
The cow has a hoop around the middle and a hat.<br>
The reason the cow has a hoop is because it just jumped over a hedge with hoops.<br>
Following behind them on the other side of the hedge is the hag on a proper horse<br>
</blockquote>
<br>
Clubs<br>
<blockquote>
A big club is held by captain caveman. He is about to hit a can with his cum.<br>
on the road goes a back to the future car.<br>
The driver of the car is coughing and in his right hand is corn on the cob.<br>
A cat sitting next to him is looking at the corn.<br>
There is a lot of cash flying out of the car. The cash is being printed on the fly with a cash printer with cogs.<br>
The girlfriend is sitting at the back with her arm around the machine and blowing kisses to the guy.<br>
</blockquote>
<br>
Diamonds<br>
<blockquote>
There is a big diamond on the floor next to the toilet in a dunny.<br>
The dunny is see through and made of a glass dome.<br>
But it has a door which is slightly open. Through the door are doves flying away from the smell to the outside.<br>
The dunny is Derren Brown's dunny and he is standing outside.<br>
One of his hands is making a dot on his forehead as if to say I will shoot you from his the assasin show.<br>
The other hand has a dish with dog food.<br>
A dog is coming to get it, but is dizzy due to the hypnosis.<br>
</blockquote>
