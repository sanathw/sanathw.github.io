<h1>Order from Chaos</h1>
There are two ways to create the Sierpinski Triangle <br>
<br>
<b>1) The Fractal way</b> - by cutting out triangles recursively<br>
<br>
<b>2) The Chaos Game.</b><br>
<br>
<br>
The intersting thing about the Chaos Game is that you do a simple process:<br>
<br>
Select an End Point RANDOMLY, then move half way to that point and put a pixel there STILL gives the Sierpinski Triangle!<br>
<br>
<font color="red">ALSO, if you DO NOT select the end points randomly, then the Sierpinski Triangle <u>disappears!!!!</u><br>
The more random, the more the pattern appears!</font> <br>
<br>
<b>So somehow, you get an ORDERED pattern from RANDOM chaos!!!!</b>

Also try a Pentagon (n = 5) with a dr = 3/8 or dr = 1/3 or dr = 1/4 (modified in code). <br>
Note that dr of 1/2 does not produce anything for the Pentagon.
<br><br>
Also try a Square (n = 4 - manually drawn) with a dr = 0.4 or dr = 1/5 (modified in code)
<br><br>
Also try n = 6 with dr = 1/3 (manually drawn and also modified in code)
<br><br>
Offcourse the triangle is: n = 3 with dr = 1/2

The "chaos game" method is mentioned in Tom Stoppard's 1993 play Arcadia.

An algorithm originally described by Barnsley in 1988. Pick a point at random inside a regular n-gon. Then draw the next point a fraction  r of the distance between it and a polygon vertex picked at random. Continue the process (after throwing out the first few points). The result of this "chaos game" is sometimes, but not always, a fractal. The results of the chaos game are shown above for several values of (n,r).

The above plots show the chaos game for 10000 points in the regular 3-, 4-, 5-, and 6-gons with r=1/2. The case (n,r)=(4,1/2) gives the interior of a square with all points visited with equal probability.

The above plots show the chaos game for 10000 points in the square with r=0.25, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.75, and 0.9.
